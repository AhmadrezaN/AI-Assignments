    "the problem of this definition is that a map includes redundant information (e.g., walls, portals and empty spaces that do not change). This leads to high memory usage and slower performance, because each time we should spend so much time on loading the map. Fortunately, we can represent the state using only the positions of the player and the boxes Instead of storing the entire map; because the only thing that changes in this game is Mike position and box locations. This reduces the state space significantly while retaining all necessary information.\n",

    "**a.**\n",
    "What is the problem with the DFS algorithm? Despite this, why is DFS still used?\n",

    "**answer:**\n",
    "DFS explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking. As a result, it may find a solution that is not optimal. for big maps, for example map 8, it is not work properly, because in dfs, algorithm go straight forward to the leaf of search tree, and big maps have really huge search trees!\n",
    "However, DFS only needs to store the current path, making it suitable for problems with large state spaces where memory is a constraint.and it can find a solution quickly if the solution is located deep in the search tree, even if it is not optimal. so because of this, dfs is used.\n",
