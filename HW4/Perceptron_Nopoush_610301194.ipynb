    "in this notebook, I tried to solve a classification problem with perceptron. To start, we need to read the data from file. note that the data is in form of [x, y, z, Q] which Q = 1 or -1. the problem is that we should find a coefficient for every {x, y, z}, for example let a,b,c,d are coefficients of {x, y, z} that if ax + by + cz + d > 0 then Q must be 1. and if not, Q must be -1. the main problem is finding the a, b, c.\n"
